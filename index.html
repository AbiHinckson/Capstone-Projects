            I have recently made the shift professionally from Administrator to Designer and my job is to build Functional Skills On-Screen English and Maths assessments for Pearson Educational Publishing. 
            I'm currently working towards a goal of academically increasing my knowledge of different computer programs (such as HTML, Javascript, Figma and Adobe Ceative Cloud etc), in order to help me develop in my current role, as well as open up more doors for job opportunties elsewhere.
